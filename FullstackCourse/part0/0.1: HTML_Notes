# HTML Basics Summary

## HTML Overview
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code used to structure web pages and their content (e.g., paragraphs, lists, images).
- It consists of a series of elements that enclose content, affecting its appearance and behavior.

## HTML Elements
- **Structure**: HTML elements consist of:
  - **Opening Tag**: Indicates where an element begins (e.g., `<p>`).
  - **Closing Tag**: Indicates where an element ends (e.g., `</p>`).
  - **Content**: The text or other elements contained within the tags.
  - **Attributes**: Provide additional information about elements (e.g., `<p class="editor-note">`).

## Nesting Elements
- Elements can be nested within one another (e.g., `<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>`).
- Proper nesting is essential to avoid errors.

## Void Elements
- Some elements do not require a closing tag (e.g., `<img src="image.png" alt="Description" />`).

## HTML Document Structure
- An HTML document consists of:
  - `<!doctype html>`: Declares the document type.
  - `<html>`: Root element of the document.
  - `<head>`: Contains metadata and links to styles/scripts (e.g., character set, title).
  - `<body>`: Contains the content displayed to users.

## Common HTML Elements
- **Images**: Use `<img>` to embed images, including `src` and `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- **Headings**: Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings and subheadings.
- **Paragraphs**: Use `<p>` for blocks of text.
- **Lists**: Use `<ul>` for unordered lists and `<ol>` for ordered lists, with `<li>` for list items.
- **Links**: Use `<a>` to create hyperlinks, specifying the target URL with the `href` attribute.
